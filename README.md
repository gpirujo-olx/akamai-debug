# akamai-debug
Set of tools to debug Akamai

The `dns` directory has one directory per country, with dns servers in many cities. The `bin` directory contains the tools.

## Tools

```
bin/georandomdns <dns_file>
```
Receives a filename in the `dns` directory. Returns one random of the IP addresses the file contains.
```
bin/resolvehost <dns> <hostname>
```
Receives the IP address of a DNS server and a hostname to resolve. Returns the IP address that the hostname resolves to, according to the DNS server.
```
bin/ixget <server> <host> [<path>]
```
Receives a server IP address or hostname, a hostname for the `Host` header, and optionally a path, if it's different from `/`. Makes an HTTP request to the server using Akamai's debug directives in the Pragma request header and returns all the response headers.
```
bin/geolookup <ip_address>
```
Receives an IP address. Returns the city, country and continent where it is located, according to Akamai's Edgescape service.
```
bin/httproute <dns_file> <server> <host> [<path>]
```
Makes an HTTP request to the server and parses the debug response headers to show the client-edge-parent-origin route, along with the geolocation of each server involved.

For example, in the following case, a request is made to an Edge server in Iran.
```
guillermo$ bin/httproute dns/ir/tiran olx.ir.edgesuite.net olx.ir
